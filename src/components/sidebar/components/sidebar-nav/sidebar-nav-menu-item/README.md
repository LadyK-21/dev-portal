# SidebarNavMenuItem

ðŸš§ This component and its docs are currently a work in progress.

All `<li>` elements rendered have `role="none"` because none of them are separators (there are no separators in this implementation) and because it removes their implied `listitem` role that comes with them being rendered inside of a `<ul>` element.
