## Getting Started

Welcome to the HashiCorp Developer Portal! This is the home for HashiCorp product reference documentation, along with all other kinds of content for our practitioners.

## Local Development

If you're developing in this repository, get started by running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will give you a development server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to write unit tests for our code. We also have [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) integrated for writing tests against our rendered React components.

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Performance

### Next Bundle Analysis

We use the [Next.js Bundle Analysis GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashicorp/nextjs-bundle-analysis) to track the size of our JavaScript bundles generated by Next.js's build step. To speed up the execution of the analysis step, we also have a [custom build script](./scripts/next-build-webpack-only.ts) which prevents the execution of the static generation build step, short-circuiting the Next.js build after the webpack compilation is finished.

## Documentation Content

Documentation for each product is sourced from its respective product repository, and served via Digital's [content API](https://github.com/hashicorp/mktg-content-workflows/#get-apicontentproductfullpath)
