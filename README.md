## Getting Started

Welcome to the HashiCorp Developer Portal! This is the home for HashiCorp product reference documentation, along with all other kinds of content for our practitioners.

## Local Development

If you're developing in this repository, get started by running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will give you a development server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to write unit tests for our code. We also have [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) integrated for writing tests against our rendered React components.

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

### Component Organization

In order to create some structure and consistency throughout this project, we're creating some light guidelines around where certain components should live. We have three top-level folders which should house components:

```
src/
  components/
  views/
  layouts/
  hooks/
  contexts/
```

- **`components`** - Shareable, smaller components for use across any number of other components
- **`views`** - Componentry which represents a full site "view." This is a way to abstract out page components and easily co-locate related code. Not necessarily intended for re-use, unless one needs to render the same view on multiple pages. This also allows us to co-locate sub-components and test files with page components, which is otherwise difficult with file-based routing
- **`layouts`** - Layout components which are generic and possibly used across different pages (see [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts#per-page-layouts))
- **`hooks`** - Shared hooks which are applicable for use across a variety of other components. Hooks which access shared contexts should live in `contexts/` (see below).
  -- **`contexts`** - Shared [contexts](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and utilities for accessing / interacting with the context values.

An example implementation of components laid out this way:

```tsx
// pages/some/page.tsx
import SomePageView from 'views/some-page'
import SomeLayout from 'layouts/some-layout'

// if we need to adjust props, can wrap this to make any changes necessary
const SomePage = SomePageView
SomePage.layout = SomeLayout

export default SomePage
```

## Performance

### Next Bundle Analysis

We use the [Next.js Bundle Analysis GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashicorp/nextjs-bundle-analysis) to track the size of our JavaScript bundles generated by Next.js's build step. To speed up the execution of the analysis step, we also have a [custom build script](./scripts/next-build-webpack-only.ts) which prevents the execution of the static generation build step, short-circuiting the Next.js build after the webpack compilation is finished.

## Documentation Content

Documentation for each product is sourced from its respective product repository, and served via Digital's [content API](https://github.com/hashicorp/mktg-content-workflows/#get-apicontentproductfullpath)
