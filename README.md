## Local Development

### Setting Up Environment Variables

There are a few things you need to set up before you can begin developing in this repository.

1. [Install the Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli)

   The CLI is needed for the next 2 steps.

2. Run `vercel link`

   This command will prompt you to connect your local copy of repo to [the Vercel `dev-portal` project](https://vercel.com/hashicorp/dev-portal). The command creates a `.vercel` directory with a JSON file that contains the information that links to the Vercel project.

3. Run `vercel env pull .env.local`

   This command will pull the development environment variables from the linked Vercel project and write them to a new file called `.env.local`.

### Running The Project

If you're developing in this repository, get started by running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will give you a development server running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to write unit tests for our code. We also have [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) integrated for writing tests against our rendered React components.

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```
